Local Representation Alignment (LRA)

LRA is a biologically inspired learning algorithm that uses local loss instead of the traditional global loss function used in backpropagation. By aligning local representations within a neural network, LRA allows each layer to independently adjust its weights based on local feedback, mimicking how the brain processes information.

Key features of LRA include:

Local Loss Computation: Each layer minimizes its own loss, leading to improved stability and generalization across different models and architectures.
Layer-wise Adaptation: Unlike backpropagation, where gradients are propagated through the entire network, LRA allows each layer to learn from its immediate output and the corresponding target.
Improved Performance: LRA has demonstrated robust performance in deep networks, reducing reliance on global loss and making networks more adaptable to varying depths.
Applications of LRA have shown significant improvements in generalization, accuracy, and stability in tasks such as classification and regression.
